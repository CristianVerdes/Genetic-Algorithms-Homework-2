# Genetic-Algorithms-Homework-2
The idea to this project is to try to maximize (finding 0) 4 functions (rast_function, griew_function, rosen_function, six_function) using:
- [Genetic algorithm] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm)
- For selecting individuals for recombination I used [roulette wheel selection] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_proportionate_selection)

## Status
- FInished

## Other mentions 
I really enjoyed working on this projects because it really felt like I "gave life" to my algorithm. Even though it lived only 
in the range (a,b), he adapted to the situation and always got better to find the solution.
